# Corvette Engineering 24 channel Electroluminescence sequencer
This code is a example of how to use the Corvette Engineering 24 channel sequencer. 
This sequencer is arduino compatible and can be easily programmed using the standard Arduino IDE.
There are 2 buttons that can be used to start / stop or anything you can dream of.
Since the buttons are really just IO they could be made into outputs,,,

The sequencer can illuminate up to 24 different EL channels in thousands of patterns. 
It only requires 7 to 12volts and an EL powersupply.
It has the option to use 1 power supply for all 24 channels or 2 seperate power supplys for 12 channels. this allows more power for those big projects
